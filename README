README (updated for 0.001) 
This is WORK UNDER CONSTRUCTION.  It seems to work
locally, but it's not yet set into production, so I guess I will get
feedback soon on all stuff that doesn't work..

I encourage everybody who thinks they might have use for this module
to have a peek at it.  It's pretty straight forward, most of the work
is done by DBIx::Recordset and HTML::Templates which is pretty stable
modules - so I guess this module will grow stable and functionally
quite quickly.

DESCRIPTION 
The intention behind DBIx::CGITables is to allow a very easy way to
put up cgi-based databases.  Anyone running a webserver might feed a
template generating script with the DD code, use two-five minutes
configurating the CGI and the web server, and then be able to access
the complete database from the web!  Further on, anyone spending some
more days of tuning should be able to generate an easy-to-use, nice
looking specialized database on the net.

I will eventually put up a mailing list, but as of today just send me
a personal mail if you have comments.  I'd appreciate any feedback,
including flames.
