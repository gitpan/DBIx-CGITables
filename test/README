This is some examples of usage of DBIx::CGITables.  Eventually those
examples should be included in the test suite.  Things are still under
development, so I can't guarantee it will just work out of the box.  It
works here.  I'd love to receive patches, comments and even flames.

The testtable directory contains the data description of a simple stupid
table with some stupid data.  It should be possible to feed mysql with those
data definitions at least - and probably most other DBMS as well.  The shell
script "maketemplates.sh" should make some ugly templates that does it
possible to view and manipulate the data in the tables.

The funlib directory contains the data structure and the templates used for
our internal library.  I've cutted some corners to get it up running here,
but anyway I feel happy with it as it turned out anyway.  Of course it won't
run straight out of the box, you should at least do a case insensitive
search for "funcom" and change it :)  It seems to work now, but we still
haven't set it into production.

I'm running Apache, and I have those lines in my httpd.conf:

ScriptAlias /cgi/ "/path/to/where/i/put/my/cgis/"
AddHandler dbt   .dbt
Action dbt /cgi/dbt.cgi

...and the templates should be somewhere within the webservers document root.
