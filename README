README
This is WORK IN CONSTRUCTION.  Currently only the POD is available.  I'm
posting this because I hope to get some comments about it.

If you desperately need a working web based database module today, I do have
the previous version of this module.  Anyway, I decided to do this from
scratch - and I have a deadline in only one week!!

DESCRIPTION
The intention behind DBIx::CGITables is to allow a very easy way to put up
cgi-based databases.  The intention is that anyone running a webserver might
feed a template generating script with the DD code, use two-five minutes
configurating the CGI and the web server, and then be able to access the
complete database from the web!  Further on, anyone spending some more days
of tuning should be able to generate an easy-to-use, nice looking
specialized database on the net.

LICENSE
The Artistic License applies at mondays, and the GNU Public License the rest
of the week.  If you incorporate this module in a commercial product at a
tuesday without asking me for permission, I might sue you.  Err, probably
not. Anyway, if you have problems due to the licensing, please send me a
mail ;)

personal mail if you have comments..
