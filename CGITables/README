README  	(updated for 0.00001)
This is WORK UNDER CONSTRUCTION.  I just tested it, and the module
itself works locally.  I encourage everybody that's interessted in
setting up web based databases to have a look at this module.

I do have a deadline to next monday for getting some usable databases
at the web - but I guess it's efficiently forwarded one week due to
Linux World Expo.

DESCRIPTION
The intention behind DBIx::CGITables is to allow a very easy way to put up
cgi-based databases.  The intention is that anyone running a webserver might
feed a template generating script with the DD code, use two-five minutes
configurating the CGI and the web server, and then be able to access the
complete database from the web!  Further on, anyone spending some more days
of tuning should be able to generate an easy-to-use, nice looking
specialized database on the net.

LICENSE
The Artistic License applies at mondays, and the GNU Public License the rest
of the week.  If you incorporate this module in a commercial product at a
tuesday without asking me for permission, I might sue you.  Err, probably
not. Anyway, if you have problems due to the licensing, please send me a
mail ;)

I will eventually put up a mailing list, but as of today just send me
a personal mail if you have comments.  I'd appreciate any feedback,
including flames.
